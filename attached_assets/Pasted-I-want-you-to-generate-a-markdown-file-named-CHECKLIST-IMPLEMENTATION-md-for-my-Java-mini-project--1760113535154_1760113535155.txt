I want you to generate a markdown file named `CHECKLIST_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for my Java mini project.

ðŸ“Œ At the very top of the markdown file, before the concept sections, add a **short explanation about Maven**:

```
## Why Maven is Used

- Maven (Apache Maven) is a build automation and project management tool.  
- It simplifies compiling, packaging, running, and managing dependencies â€” so I donâ€™t need to manually compile multiple `.java` files.  
- Instead of remembering many commands, I can use:
  `mvn compile` and `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="..."`.
- It ensures the same build works on every machine (clean and portable).  
- Dependencies (like external libraries) are managed through `pom.xml` instead of manual jar handling.
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ CHECKLIST SECTION

1. Scan the entire project folder and identify where each of the following Java concepts is implemented:
   - Classes & Objects  
   - Encapsulation  
   - Inheritance  
   - Polymorphism  
   - Abstraction  
   - Constructors (default, parameterized, overloading, chaining)  
   - Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default)  
   - Packages (project structure)  
   - Exception Handling (try-catch-finally, custom exception)  
   - Generics  
   - Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Iterators, Lambda if used)  
   - File Handling (if present)

2. For each concept found, create a **separate markdown section** in the following format:

````markdown
## [Concept Name]

| Concept | File Name | Class/Method | How it is implemented | Why it is used | What role it plays | Other files using it |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| [Concept] | [filename.java] | [method/class name] | [Short explanation of how this code implements the concept] | [Why you used it here] | [Its role in the project] | [Other related files] |

### ðŸ§¾ Code Snippet:
```java
// paste the relevant code snippet (5â€“10 lines max)
```
Make sure the code snippet comes directly from the file (not just a description).

If a concept appears in multiple files, make multiple rows for that concept.

At the end of the markdown file, add a:

markdown
Copy code
## Quick Links
- [Concept Name](#concept-name) â€” filename.java (method / line)
- [Concept Name](#concept-name) â€” filename2.java (method / line)
Format the markdown cleanly and in a structured way so I can show it during viva and directly jump to the file if needed.

## Why Everything is in ONE File?

### ❌ **Problem:**
- **Not following best practices** - Everything is cramped in one file
- **Hard to maintain** - Finding specific functions is difficult
- **No separation of concerns** - All menus, all roles, all logic in one place

### ✅ **Should Be:**
Each role should have its own menu handler:
- `PrincipalMenuHandler.java` - Handle all principal operations
- `AdminMenuHandler.java` - Handle all admin operations
- `TeacherMenuHandler.java` - Handle all teacher operations
- `StudentMenuHandler.java` - Handle all student operations
- `MenuSystem.java` - Main menu coordination

## Breakdown by Numbers:

| Component | Approximate Lines | What It Does |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Principal menus | ~600 lines | Add admins/teachers, create courses |
| Admin menus | ~800 lines | Register students/teachers, manage courses |
| Teacher menus | ~900 lines | Assignments, grades, messages |
| Student menus | ~700 lines | View assignments, submit work, grades |
| Validation loops | ~400 lines | Retry logic for invalid inputs |
| Helper methods | ~300 lines | Data loading, display, utilities |
| Initialization | ~100 lines | System setup |

**Total: ~3,800 lines**

## Simple Answer:

**Main.java = Entry Point + Complete Interactive Menu System for ALL 4 User Roles (Principal, Admin, Teacher, Student)**

It's like putting your entire restaurant (kitchen + dining + billing + management) in ONE room instead of separate areas. It works, but it's crowded! 🏢

## Better Approach (For Future):

```
sms/
├── app/
│   ├── Main.java                    (100 lines - just entry point)
│   ├── MenuSystem.java              (200 lines - menu coordination)
│   └── menus/
│       ├── PrincipalMenuHandler.java  (600 lines)
│       ├── AdminMenuHandler.java      (800 lines)
│       ├── TeacherMenuHandler.java    (900 lines)
│       └── StudentMenuHandler.java    (700 lines)
```

This keeps Main.java clean and organizes code by responsibility! 📁
